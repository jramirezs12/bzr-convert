This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Avatar Upload Feature

This application includes a file upload feature using Vercel Blob for handling larger files (>4.5MB) that exceed platform body size limits.

### Usage

Visit `/avatar/upload` to access the upload page where you can upload image files directly to Vercel Blob storage.

### Local Development

When running locally, the `onUploadCompleted` webhook requires a public callback URL. Use a tunnel service like ngrok and set the callback URL in your `.env.local`:

```bash
VERCEL_BLOB_CALLBACK_URL=https://abc123.ngrok-free.app
```

### Supported File Types

- JPEG (.jpg, .jpeg)
- PNG (.png)
- WebP (.webp)
- AVIF (.avif)

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
